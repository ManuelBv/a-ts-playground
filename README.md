# a-ts-playground
A simple TS repo for playing around with TypeScript using `ts-node` and also running tests using `jest`.

## Setup

1. Use node version 16: `nvm use 16`
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Watch for changes and run code in `./src/index.ts`: `npm run watch`
4. Watch for changes and run tests: `npm run test`
5. Build files in `/build` folder: `npm run build`

## Contributing

Trunk based development: branch off `main`, merge your feature branch back into `main`.
